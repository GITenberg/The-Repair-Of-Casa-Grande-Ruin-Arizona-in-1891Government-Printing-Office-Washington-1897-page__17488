<h2>THE REPAIR OF CASA GRANDE RUIN</h2>

<hr class = "tiny">

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>


<p>In March, 1889, an appropriation of $2,000 was made by Congress for
the repair of Casa Grande ruin in southern Arizona. This amount was
insufficient for complete restoration, but under the authority of the
act of Congress making the appropriation some work was done. Partly as
an aid to further possible work, and partly that there may be an
available record of what has been done for the benefit of future
students of American archeology, this report is presented.</p>

<p>A full description of Casa Grande has been given by the writer in a
published memoir<a class = "tag" name = "tag1" href = "#note1">1</a> on
that ruin, hence only a brief account will now be necessary to aid in
making the present report intelligible. Following this description is a
statement of the condition of the ruin in 1891 and of the plans formed
for its repair, the latter being necessarily controlled by the amount
appropriated. After this there is an account of the work done, from the
passage of the bill until the delivery of the work to the agent of the
United States who received it, and of the reservation, of an area of
land about the ruin by order of the President. This is followed by a
catalogue of the articles found during the excavations in and about the
ruin, which were subsequently deposited in the National Museum; a
transcript of the contract under which the work was done, including
specifications, plans, and sections, and the report of Mr H.&nbsp;C.
Rizer, who inspected and received the work. Finally, there are appended
the correspondence and report relating to the condition of Casa Grande
in 1895, with recommendations concerning its further protection.</p>

<p>Casa Grande has occupied a very important place in the literature of
American archeology, a place which it doubtless will continue to occupy;
and as dates are frequently of importance an effort has been made to
make the present report as full as possible in that respect.</p>

<h3>DESCRIPTION OF THE RUINS</h3>

<p>Casa Grande appears to be the sole surviving remnant of an extensive
and important class of remains in the southwest. These remains occur
usually in large groups or clusters, and Casa Grande is no exception.
<span class = "pagenum">322</span>
<a name = "page322"> </a>
The name has been ordinarily applied to a single house structure
standing near the southwestern corner of a large area covered by mounds
and other debris; but some writers have applied the term to the
southwestern portion of the area, others to the whole area.</p>

<p>Probably no two investigators would assign exactly the same limits to
this area, as its margins merge imperceptibly into the surrounding
country. The accompanying map (plate <a href = "#plate112"><span class =
"smallroman">CXII</span></a>) shows the limits of the ruins as
interpreted by the writer. The surface covered by well-defined remains,
as there shown, extends about 1,800 feet north and south and 1,500 feet
east and west, or a total area of about 65 acres.</p>

<p>Casa Grande ruin occupies a position near the southwestern corner of
the group, and its size is insignificant as compared with the entire
cluster of ruins, or even with the remains of the large structure which
occupied the north-central part of the area. The contour interval on the
map is 1 foot, sufficiently small to show much surface detail. The
depressions are indicated by dotted contours.</p>

<p>Within the area shown on the map there are a large number of mounds,
more or less leveled by long-continued exposure to the elements. Some
appear to be quite old, others represent buildings which were standing
within the historic period, and many interesting features are presented
which can not even be alluded to here.</p>

<p>Casa Grande proper was one of the smallest of the house clusters, but
it is unique in that the walls are still standing to a height of more
than 25 feet. While fragments of standing wall are not uncommon, either
in the area mentioned or in the valleys of Gala and Salt rivers
generally, no other example exists, so far as known, so well preserved
as the one under consideration.</p>

<p>For miles around Casa Grande the ground surface is so flat that from
the summit of the walls an immense stretch of country is brought under
view in every direction. In the whole southwest, where there are
thousands of ruins, many of which represent villages located with
especial reference to outlook, there are few, if any, so well situated
as this.</p>

<p>A ground plan of the ruin is shown in plate <a href =
"#plate112"><span class = "smallroman">CXII</span></a> and a general
view in plate <a href = "#plate114"><span class =
"smallroman">CXIV</span></a>. The area covered and inclosed by standing
walls is about 43 by 59 feet, but the building is not exactly
rectangular, nor do its sides exactly face the cardinal points,
notwithstanding many published statements to that effect. The building
comprised three central rooms, each approximately 10 by 24 feet,
arranged side by side with the longer axes north and south, and two
other rooms, each about 9 by 35 feet, occupying, respectively, the
northern and southern ends of the building, and arranged transversely
across the ends of the central rooms, the longer axes running east and
west. Excepting the central tier of rooms, which was three stories high,
all the walls rose to a height of two stories above the ground. The
northeastern and southeastern corners of the structure have fallen, and
large blocks of the material of which they were composed are strewn upon
the ground in the vicinity.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">323</span>
<a name = "page323"> </a>
The exterior walls rise to a height of from 20 to 25 feet above the
ground. This height accommodated two stories, but the top of the wall is
from 1 to 2 feet higher than the roof level of the second story. The
middle room or space was built up three stories high, and the walls are
still standing to a height of 28 to 30 feet above the ground level. The
tops of the walls, while rough and greatly eroded, are approximately
level. The exterior surface of the walls is rough, as shown in the
illustrations, but the interior walls of the rooms are finished with a
remarkable degree of smoothness, so much so that it has attracted the
attention of everyone who has visited the ruin. Plate <a href =
"#plate115"><span class = "smallroman">CXV</span></a> shows this
feature. At the ground level the exterior wall is from 3½ to 4½ feet
thick, and in one place over 5 feet thick. The interior walls are from 3
to 4 feet thick. At the tops the walls are about 2 feet thick. The
building was constructed by crude methods, thoroughly aboriginal in
character, and there is no uniformity in its measurements. The walls,
even in the same room, are not of even thickness; the floor joists were
seldom in a straight line, and measurements made at similar places (for
example, at the two ends of a room) seldom agree.</p>

<p>Casa Grande is often referred to as an adobe structure, but this use
of the term is misleading. Adobe construction consists of the use of
molded brick, dried in the sun, but not baked. The walls here are
composed of huge blocks of rammed earth, 3 to 5 feet long, 2 feet high
and 3 to 4 feet thick. These blocks were not molded and then laid in the
wall, but were manufactured in place.</p>

<p>Plate <a href = "#plate116"><span class =
"smallroman">CXVI</span></a> shows the character of these blocks. The
material employed was admirably suited for the purpose, being when dry
almost as hard as sandstone and nearly as durable. A building with walls
of this material would last indefinitely, provided a few slight repairs
were made at the conclusion of each rainy season. When abandoned,
however, sapping at the ground level would commence and would in time
bring down all the walls; yet in the two centuries which have elapsed
since Padre Kino's visit to this place&mdash;and Casa Grande was then a
ruin&mdash;there has been but little destruction from the elements, the
damage done by relic hunters during the last twenty years being, in
fact, much greater than that due to all causes in the preceding two
centuries.</p>

<p>The building was well provided with doorways and other openings,
arranged in pairs, one above the other. There were doorways from each
room into every adjoining room, except that the rooms of the middle tier
were entered only from the east. Some of the openings were not used, and
were closed with blocks of solid masonry, built into them long prior to
the final abandonment of the structure.</p>

<h3>CONDITION OF CASA GRANDE IN 1891</h3>

<p>The south and east fronts of Casa Grande seem to have suffered,
particularly from the weather, and here rainstorms have probably caused
some of the damage. The outer faces of the walls are of the same
material as the wall mass, all the masonry being composed of
<span class = "pagenum">324</span>
<a name = "page324"> </a>
earth from the immediate site. In the construction of the walls this
soil was laid up in successive courses of varying thickness, whose
limits form clearly defined and approximately horizontal joints. The
northeast and southeast corners of the building have entirely fallen
away, and low mounds of their debris still show many knobs and lumps,
parts of the original wall mass.</p>

<p>The destruction of the walls was due mainly to undermining at the
ground level. The character of this undermining is shown in many of the
illustrations to this report, especially in plate <a href =
"#plate116"><span class = "smallroman">CXVI</span></a>, and its extent
is indicated on the accompanying ground plan (plate <a href =
"#plate117"><span class = "smallroman">CXVII</span></a>) by dotted lines
within the wall mass. Although the material of which the walls are
composed is very hard when dry, and capable of resisting the destructive
influences to which it has been subjected for a long time, yet under
certain conditions it becomes more yielding. The excessively dry climate
of this region, which in one respect has made the preservation of the
ruin possible, has also furnished, in its periodic sandstorms, a most
efficient agent of destruction. The amount of moisture in the soil is so
small as scarcely to be detected, but what there is in the soil next to
the walls is absorbed by the latter, rising doubtless by capillary
attraction to a height of a foot or more from the ground. This portion
of the wall being then more moist than the remainder, although possibly
only in an infinitesimal degree, is more subject to erosion by flying
sand in the windstorms so frequent in this region, and gradually the
base of the wall is eaten away until the support becomes insufficient
and the wall falls en masse. The plan shows that in some places the
walls have been eaten away at the ground level to a depth of more than a
foot. Portions of the south wall were in a dangerous condition and
likely to fall at any time.</p>

<p>Visiting tourists have done much damage by their vandalism. They have
torn out and carried away every lintel and every particle of visible
wood in the building. After the removal of the lintels a comparatively
short time elapses before the falling in of the wall above. Apparently
but a small amount of this damage can be attributed to rainstorms,
which, although rare in this region, are sometimes violent. There is
evidence that the present height of the walls is nearly the original
height, in other words, that the loss from surface erosion in several
centuries has been trifling, although numerous opinions to the contrary
have been expressed by causal observers. The eastern wall has suffered
more from this cause than the others; a belt on the northern half,
apparently softer than the remainder of the wall, has been eaten away to
a depth of nearly a foot. The interior wall faces are in good condition
generally, except about openings and in places near the&nbsp;top.</p>

<p>Evidences of the original flooring are preserved in several of the
rooms, especially in the north room. The flooring conformed to the
pueblo type in the use of a series of principal beams, about 3 inches in
diameter, above which was a secondary series smaller in size and placed
<span class = "pagenum">325</span>
<a name = "page325"> </a>
quite close together, and above this again a layer of rushes with a
coating of clay. All the walls show evidences of the principal series of
beams in the line of holes formed by their ends where they were embedded
in the walls. In the south wall, in parts of the east wall high up on
the level of the upper roof, and in parts of other walls a few stumps of
floor beams remained. These specimens of aboriginal woodwork have
survived only because they are not in sight from the ground, and their
existence therefore was not suspected by the tourists. Evidence of the
other features of the floor construction can be seen on the walls in
places where they have left an imprint, as described in the memoir
previously cited.</p>

<p>No single opening remains intact, as the lintels have been removed
from every one of them. This is particularly unfortunate, for openings
at their best are an element of weakness in a wall, and here each
opening, after the lintel was removed, became, as it were, a center of
weakness from which the destruction of the wall mass gradually proceeded
further and further.</p>

<h3>PLANS FOR THE REPAIRS</h3>

<p>The plans for the repair of the ruin and its preservation included
the reservation of the area covered by remains and, if possible, its
inclosure, for within that area are exhibited all the various degrees of
decay and disintegration which clearly link the comparatively well
preserved Casa Grande with the numerous almost obliterated ruins along
the Gila and the Salt, whose vestiges will become even less distinct as
time passes and cultivation increases.</p>

<p>It was deemed necessary to remove all the rubbish and debris within
the building and from an area measuring 10 feet from the outer walls in
every direction. Plate <a href = "#plate117"><ins class = "correction"
title = "text reads 'VI'"><span class =
"smallroman">CXVII</span></ins></a> shows the extent of this area, and
six sections are shown in plates <a href = "#plate118"><ins class =
"correction" title = "text reads 'VII'"><span class =
"smallroman">CXVIII</span></ins></a> and <a href = "#plate119"><ins
class = "correction" title = "text reads 'VIII'"><span class =
"smallroman">CXIX</span></ins></a>, three on east-and-west lines and
three on north-and-south lines. The lines along which these sections
were made are indicated on the plan, plate <a href = "#plate117"><span
class = "smallroman">CXVII</span></a>. The ground level was determined
by excavation, and is of course only approximate. The sections show the
estimated amount of debris which was to be removed. Aside from other
considerations, it was necessary to uncover the walls to the ground
level in order to do the necessary underpinning.</p>

<p>It was planned to underpin the walls, where erosion at the ground
level had weakened them, with hard-burned brick laid in cement mortar.
Plate <a href = "#plate117"><span class = "smallroman">CXVII</span></a>
shows in a measure the extent of this erosion. The brick surface was to
be set back an inch or two and faced with that thickness of cement
mortar. Plate <a href = "#plate120"><span class =
"smallroman">CXX</span></a> shows the south front and plate <a href =
"#plate121"><span class = "smallroman">CXXI</span></a> the south and
east fronts when the brickwork was completed, but before it was
plastered, and will illustrate what was planned better than can a
description.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">326</span>
<a name = "page326"> </a>
This treatment, it was believed, would give a surface capable of
effectually resisting atmospheric influences and the destructive action
of flying sand, and at the same time would not disfigure the ruin by
making the repairs obtrusive.</p>

<p>The broken-out lintels of openings were to be replaced, and the
cavities above them filled in with brick faced with mortar similar to
the underpinning.</p>

<p>The south wall, which was in a dangerous condition, was to be
supported by three internal braces, as shown in the plan, plate <a href
= "#plate117"><span class = "smallroman">CXVII</span></a>. The longest
brace or beam was necessarily of wood, as the wide range of temperature
in this region, even between day and night, would produce so much
expansion and contraction in an iron rod 60 feet long that without some
compensating device the wall would be rocked on its base and its rapid
destruction necessarily follow.</p>

<h3>EXECUTION OF THE WORK</h3>

<p>Appended to that portion of the sundry civil appropriation act
approved March. 2, 1889,<a class = "tag" name = "tag2" href =
"#note2">2</a> in which certain expenses of the United States Geological
Survey are provided for, is the following item:</p>

<blockquote>
Repair of the ruin of Casa Grande, Arizona: To enable the Secretary of
the Interior to repair and protect the ruin of Casa Grande, situate in
Pinal County, near Florence, Arizona, two thousand dollars; and the
President is authorized to reserve from settlement and sale the land on
which said ruin is situated and so much of the public land adjacent
thereto as in his judgment may be necessary for the protection of said
ruin and of the ancient city of which it is a part.
</blockquote>

<p>On the 12th of April, 1889, there was a conference between the
Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of the General Land
Office looking to the execution of the law, and on the 16th of that
month the Commissioner submitted a statement on the subject, calling
attention to the fact that the appropriation would not be available
until July 1 following, and suggesting that a special agent should be
sent out to examine the ruin. This suggestion was approved, and on April
27, 1889, Special Agent Alexander L. Morrison, of the General Land
Office, was instructed to proceed to the ruins for the purpose of
investigating and reporting as to what method should be adopted for
their repair and protection. Mr Morrison was further instructed to
report "all the facts obtainable as regards said ruins of 'Casa Grande,'
in order that appropriate action may be taken by the Department for its
preservation."</p>

<p>On May 15,1889, Mr Morrison submitted a report to the Commissioner,
describing his journey, the location of the ruin, the ruin itself, and
other ruins in the vicinity. He stated that danger to the ruin was of
three kinds&mdash;(1) by vandalism, (2) by elements, (3) by undermining.
He recommended the construction of a roof and an underpinning of
<span class = "pagenum">327</span>
<a name = "page327"> </a>
stone for the walls. Finally, he gave some historical notes, and closed
with a peroration.</p>

<p>Mr Morrison's plans were found impracticable, as their execution
would require an expenditure of many times the sum appropriated, and on
September 23, 1889, all the papers in the case were transmitted by the
Secretary to the Director of the Geological Survey, "for appropriate
action under the clause of the act referred to, as being within the
province of your Bureau." It was ordered that the work be commenced
without the least delay, and November 27, 1889, Mr Victor Mindeleff, of
the Bureau of Ethnology, was detailed by the Director and ordered to
proceed to the ruin and report on the best means of repairing it and
protecting it from further destruction. He was also directed to make
other investigations in the vicinity, which have no relation to the
present case.</p>

<p>On July 1, 1890, Mr Mindeleff submitted a report. He described the
ruins of which Casa Grande is the type, and also Casa Grande itself. He
also made a statement of the condition of the ruin and suggested that
the main destruction "was due to the undermining of the walls, and
stated that much damage had been done by tourists. He recommended (1)
that an area about the ruin be fenced in; (2) that a man be located
permanently on the ground to watch the ruins; (3) that the ruins be
cleaned out; (4) that the walls be underpinned with brick instead of
stone, as previously suggested; (5) that the tops of the walls, after
removing several inches to afford a good bearing surface, be treated
with a coping of cement. It was regarded that this plan, if carried into
effect, would afford sufficient protection against the weather, but a
plan for a roof was submitted should such a structure be deemed
desirable and practicable. Mr Mindeleff also recommended a number of
tie-rods and beams, the replacement of the broken-out lintels, and the
filling of the cavities above.</p>

<p>This plan was approved in its general features, but the means
provided for its execution were found insufficient. A further
complication arose from the fact that a few months later Mr Mindeleff
severed his connection with the Bureau of Ethnology and his knowledge
became no longer available.</p>

<p>November 20, 1890, the writer was ordered to proceed to the ruin and
inaugurate the work of repair, following, so far as practicable, the
plans already approved. He left Washington soon afterward and reached
the ruin late in December. It was found necessary to make a detailed
survey of the ruin and of the group of which it forms a part, and to
make plans and sections showing the probable amount of excavation for
the use of those who were invited to bid on the work. Furthermore, the
amount appropriated was so well known to be inadequate that great
difficulty was experienced in obtaining bids, and it was only through
the efficient cooperation of the Reverend I.&nbsp;T. Whittemore at Florence
and of Mr C.&nbsp;A. Garlick at Phoenix that success was finally
<span class = "pagenum">328</span>
<a name = "page328"> </a>
achieved. Two bids were received from the former place and one from the
latter; but this was not accomplished until March 17, 1891, the date
when the last bid was received. In the meantime the writer, having
completed his work at Casa Grande, so far as he could, had entered, in
January, on an archeologic investigation of the valley of the Rio Verde,
in compliance with his orders to that effect.</p>

<p>It was found impossible to execute all the work deemed requisite for
the preservation of the ruin within the limits of the appropriation. A
selection of items became necessary, therefore, and those which were of
most importance were chosen. Even in this, however, it was found that a
maximum limit on the amount of work to be done on each item must be set,
and this limit was considerably below the amount of work estimated to be
necessary.</p>

<p>The first thing to be done was, of course, the clearing out of the
rubbish and debris. The item next in importance was the underpinning of
the walls with brick wherever it was needed. The third item was the
restoration of the lintels and the filling of the cavities above them.
The fourth item was the tying in of the south wall, or of the several
parts of it, with braces. This was the only feature of the plan which
would appreciably disfigure the ruin, but some such device was deemed
essential for the preservation of the south wall.</p>

<p>These four items consumed practically all of the amount appropriated,
and the other items of the original plan were therefore omitted. The bid
of T.&nbsp;L. Stouffer and F.&nbsp;E. White, of Florence, Arizona,
covering the four items, was accepted, and a contract was made with
them, under date of May 9, 1891, for the execution of the work for the
sum of $1,985. This contract, together with the specifications, plans,
and other drawings which formed part of it, accompany this report. It
was transmitted to the Director of the Geological Survey, and by him
approved and forwarded to the Secretary of the Interior June 6, 1891. It
was approved by the Acting Secretary June 20, 1891. Finally, on July 20,
1891, it was placed on file, together "with the bids, proposals, and all
the original papers."</p>

<p>A time limit of two months was made in the contract, expiring August
20, 1891, but it was changed to four months from July 1, 1891, expiring
October 31, 1891. Before the time expired, however, Mr H.&nbsp;G. Rizer,
then chief clerk of the Bureau of Ethnology, was ordered to proceed to
Casa Grande ruin to examine the work done and, if in accord with the
terms of the contract and the specifications, to certify the amount due
the contractors. He submitted a report, under date of November 24, 1891,
which is appended hereto. He also obtained six photographic negatives of
the work as it stood a short time before its completion, and two of
these (reproduced in plates <a href = "#plate120"><span class =
"smallroman">CXX</span></a> and <a href = "#plate121"><span class =
"smallroman">CXXI</span></a>) have been utilized in the preparation of
this report.</p>

<p>Mr Rizer found that a considerable amount of work had been done by
the contractors in excess of that authorized, and also that not
sufficient
<span class = "pagenum">329</span>
<a name = "page329"> </a>
work had been done to render the repairs permanently effective. Under
the terms of the contract, no amount in excess of that stated ($1,985)
could be paid, and payment of this amount was made late in 1891. On
January 7, 1892, the contractors filed a claim for extra work on the
ruin amounting to $600.40. The work was actually performed, but the
terms of the contract were clear, and the claim was therefore
disapproved January 28, 1892.</p>

<p>It would have been desirable to have had a supervisor of the work,
but as the contract consumed practically all of the amount appropriated
no provision could be made for one. It is fortunate, therefore, that the
Reverend I.&nbsp;T. Whittemore, who had in the meantime been appointed
honorary custodian of the ruin, generously undertook to look after the
work without compensation, and on its conclusion the small sum remaining
($15) was turned over to him, thus exhausting the appropriation. In the
sundry civil appropriation act for the year ending June 30, 1893,
provision was made for a salaried custodian of the ruin, and Mr
Whittemore was appointed to this position. Similar provision has been
continued from year to year to the present time.</p>

<p>It is to be regretted that the necessities of the case, imposed by
the limited amount appropriated, compelled the fixing of a maximum
amount of work so far below the amount necessary that the repair of the
ruin is incomplete. Had it been possible to carry out the plans, it is
believed that the ruin would have stood unchanged for many decades, if
not for a century. Should further provision be made for the continuation
of the work, it should include an item for the fencing of the area
covered by the ruins or of the reservation, and possibly an item for the
construction of a roof.</p>

<p>It is not clear that a roof is absolutely necessary, but it is
certain that it would be very undesirable. The region where this rain
occurs has probably less rainfall than any other part of the United
States, but it must not be forgotten that while rainstorms are
infrequent they are sometimes violent, and what damage they do may be
done in a few hours. All the items for the repair of the ruin, except
that pertaining to a roof, were so devised that the ruin was not
materially disfigured or changed, and were they fully carried out the
ruin would present much the same general appearance as before. It is
important that this appearance should be preserved as far as possible,
but it can not be maintained if a roof is erected over the walls. As
four years have elapsed since the completion of the work, it should be
possible now to determine whether atmospheric erosion has played a
material part in the work of destruction.<a class = "tag" name = "tag3"
href = "#note3">3</a></p>

<p>In the original plans and in the specifications which formed part of
the contract (although this section was not operative) a plan for a roof
was included. Such a structure, if erected at all, should be made as
<span class = "pagenum">330</span>
<a name = "page330"> </a>
inconspicuous as possible and should be supported entirely from within
the building. The system of framing employed might safely be left to the
contractor if he were made responsible for the strength of the completed
structure.</p>

<h3>RESERVATION OF THE LAND</h3>

<p>The final step in the execution of the law quoted was taken June 22,
1892. On that date the recommendation of the writer to the Director of
the Geological Survey, referred by him to the Secretary of the Interior
and by the latter to the President, was finally approved, and it was
ordered that an area of land sufficient for the preservation of the
ruin, and comprising in all 480 acres, be reserved under authority of
act of Congress approved March 2, 1889. This area is shown on the map
reproduced in plate <a href = "#plate125"><span class =

the report of Mr H.&nbsp;C. Rizer.</p>

<h4>II. PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS FOR THE PRESERVATION OF THE CASA GRANDE
RUIN, ARIZONA, 1891</h4>

<h4>(<i>Attached to and forming part of contract</i>)</h4>

<h5>GENERAL REQUIREMENTS</h5>

<p>All the work upon this ruin is to be carried out in such a manner as
to interfere as little as possible with the present condition and
appearance of the building, and the contractors will be held responsible
for any injury to&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>The work is to be carried on under a supervisor, acting for the
United States, who shall have power to reject any materials it is
proposed to use in the work which are not in his judgment equal to those
specified, and he shall have power to have torn down any work done which
he has reason to suspect is not such as required by the specifications,
but if such work shall prove upon inspection to have been well done the
contractor may make a charge of the amount which would have been allowed
for that part of the work had it passed inspection.</p>

<p>When the work is completed it must pass the final inspection of the
supervisor, or such person as the Secretary of the Interior may
designate for the purpose.</p>

<h5>1. CLEARING OUT THE DÉBRIS</h5>

<p>The débris now filling up the interior is to be removed down to the
floor level, or the original ground level. The débris covering an area
<span class = "pagenum">336</span>
<a name = "page336"> </a>
measuring 10 feet from the exterior walls of the building in every
direction is also to be removed. This work is to be carried on in
conjunction with the underpinning of the walls, and is to be dependent
upon the progress of the latter, the work being done as required by the
person holding the contract for the underpinning. All proper precautions
must be observed during the progress of the work to prevent any injury
to the building, the walls being properly braced and supported before
excavation is commenced. The contractor will be held responsible for any
injury to the building. Any objects found of archeologic or other value
properly belong to the United States and must be deposited in the
National Museum. The material removed from the building and from the
area about it is to be removed to a proper distance, not less than 100
yards from the building. Proper drainage channels must be provided to
keep the excavated area permanently clear of water.</p>

<h5>2. UNDERPINNING WALLS</h5>

<p>The walls where eroded at the ground level are to be underpinned with
hard-burned brick, laid in good cement mortar and extending to a depth
of at least 12 inches below the original ground level. This work must be
carried on gradually and very carefully in conjunction with the clearing
out of the débris. The under surfaces of the overhanging walls must be
carefully trimmed to afford solid horizontal bearings against the
brickwork. The face of the brickwork is to be set back at least 1 inch
and not more than 2 inches from the face of the wall, and the brickwork
is to be plastered with a coating of cement mortar, 1 to 2 inches thick,
bringing it out flush with the outer wall.</p>

<h5>3. FILLING IN OPENINGS</h5>

<p>The broken-out lintels of openings are to be replaced by wooden
lintels composed of squared lumber, 2 by 4 inches in size, laid side by
side across nearly the whole thickness of the walls, with not more than
1 inch space between the boards, and of the same length as the original
lintels. The broken-out walls are to be trimmed to afford solid resting
places for the new lintels, which are to occupy the same horizontal
planes that the old ones did. The openings above the lintels are to be
filled in in the same manner as the underpinning previously described,
the tinder wall surfaces being carefully dressed to afford solid
horizontal bearings, the brick work being set back 1 inch from the wall
surfaces and plastered with a coating of cement mortar to bring it out
flush with the wall.</p>

<h5>4. BRACING</h5>

<p>One wooden brace and two iron braces are to be put in, as shown upon
the plan hereto annexed. The wooden brace is to be of one piece, or of
two pieces well bolted together, of selected lumber, free from knots and
other imperfections, squared, and measuring 6 by 8 inches in
<span class = "pagenum">337</span>
<a name = "page337"> </a>
cross section. The iron braces are to be of 1 inch diameter, best
quality wrought-iron rods. The bearing plates, four to each rod, are to
be not less than 10 inches in diameter, of sufficient strength, and
securely and permanently fastened to the braces.</p>

<h5>5. WIRE FENCING</h5>

<p>Such area as may be determined is to be fenced with the best quality
of galvanized iron barbed wire, strung upon posts placed 20 feet apart.
The posts are to be of mesquite, not less than 3 inches in diameter and
of a reasonable degree of straightness (not varying more than 5 inches
from a straight line). The posts are to be at least 6 feet 6 inches long
and are to be planted perpendicularly with 4 feet 6 inches clear and at
least 2 feet below the ground surface. Three lines of double wire are to
be stretched upon and securely fastened to the posts, the first at a
distance of 2 feet from the ground, the second at 3 feet, and the third
at 4 feet from the ground. Two gateways are to be provided, at such
points as may be directed, the side posts to be of squared timber, 6 by
6 inches in cross section, and the gates to be made of sawed lumber 1
inch by 5 inches, hung upon good iron hinges, and leaving a clear space
of not less than 12 feet when open, the whole to be executed in the best
and most workmanlike manner.</p>

<h5>6. ROOF</h5>

<p>The building is to be crowned by a roof of corrugated iron, supported
in the manner shown in the accompanying plan and sections. The uprights
are to be of selected squared lumber 1 foot square, each in a single
piece, the lower ends planted at least 3 feet below the original ground
level, and to be braced and tied to each other, as shown in the plan.
The tie pieces are to be of selected squared lumber, 4 inches by 6
inches in cross section. The roof is to be framed and braced in the
ordinary manner, and this framing is to extend beyond the outer wall 6
feet. The covering is to be a good quality of corrugated iron roofing,
securely fastened to the framework, and painted with three good coats of
the best quality of roof paint. The whole to be constructed and
executed, in the best and most workmanlike manner, of good materials
throughout, and to be of a strength sufficient to withstand the
windstorms to which it may be subjected.</p>

<i>Director of the Bureau of Ethnology</i>.</div>

<div class = "letter">
<span class = "smallcaps">Sir</span>: Complying with your order
directing me to proceed to Florence, Arizona, to witness the closing up
of the work under contract for the preservation of Casa Grande ruin near
that place, and to report to you the amount and character of the work
accomplished, certifying the amount due the contractors under each item,
I have the honor to submit the following report:</div>

<div class = "letter">
I visited the ruin first on October 20, and found the work well
advanced. Steady progress was made from said date until October 31, the
limitation expressed in the contract for prosecuting&nbsp;it.</div>

<div class = "letter">
In order to ascertain the exact location of Casa Grande ruin and to aid
me in the determination of the amount of work performed by the
contractors, I employed Mr Albert T. Colton, a civil engineer and the
official surveyor of Pinal county, Arizona, within the limits of which
the ruin stands. From actual measurements made by Mr Colton, based upon
official notes in his custody, he informed me the ruin was located in
the northeast corner of the northwest quarter of the southwest quarter
of section 16 of township 5 south, range 8 east. A congressional
township plat on which Mr Colton has marked the exact location of the
ruin is filed herewith, marked Exhibit A, and made a part of this report
[plate <a href = "#plate125"><span class =
"smallroman">CXXV</span></a>].</div>

<div class = "letter">
On October 29 Mr Colton at my instance took measurements of the
brickwork in underpinning and filling in cavities in the walls and of
the excavation done by the contractors. His estimate, based upon these
measurements, was submitted to me in writing. It is filed herewith,
marked Exhibit B, and is made a part of this report.</div>

<div class = "letter">
I find from these measurements that the contractors excavated and
removed to a point 100 yards from the ruin 570 cubic yards of débris,
271 cubic yards of which were removed from the interior and 299 cubic
<span class = "pagenum">341</span>
<a name = "page341"> </a>
yards from the exterior walls of the building, within an area of 10 feet
of said walls.</div>

<div class = "letter">
I also find the amount of underpinning done by the contractors to be 919
cubic feet, and the amount of filling in openings to be 1,161 cubic
feet. The underpinning is done with hard-burned brick laid in good
cement mortar extending to a depth of 12 inches below the original
ground level. The face of the brickwork is set back from 1 to 2 inches
from the face of the wall and plastered with a coat of good cement
mortar, making it flush with the outer wall.</div>

<div class = "letter">
In filling in cavities more than 500 lineal feet of 2 by 4 inch squared
lumber was used to replace broken-out lintels and laid side by side
across nearly the whole thickness of the walls, with not more than 1
inch space between the boards. They occupy the same horizontal planes as
the original lintels, and the walls are trimmed to afford solid resting
places for them. The openings above the lintels have been filled in the
same manner as the underpinning, with hard-burned brick set back 1 inch
from the wall surfaces and plastered with a coating of cement mortar,
bringing it out flush with the original wall.</div>

<div class = "letter">
I further find that the contractors have placed one wooden brace and two
iron braces as designated in the specifications. The wooden brace is
constructed of two pieces of good, clear, squared lumber 6 by 8 inches
in cross section, well bolted together, secured by plates of boiler iron
three-eighths of an inch thick and 14 by 18 inches square. The
specifications provide for this brace to run from the south side of the
south wall through the center room with a plate on each side of the
south wall and one on each side of the wall on the north side of the
center room. The contractors have deviated from these requirements in
having extended the said brace through the entire length of the building
and placed the plates that were specified for the north wall of the
center room on the respective sides of the extreme north wall of the
building. While this deviation adds nothing to the security of the south
wall, it is doubtless as effective as it would have been had it been
placed as contemplated in the plan. It may in some degree strengthen the
north wall, and I recommend that it be accepted as in compliance with
the terms of the contract. The two iron rods called for in the
specifications are of wrought iron 1½ inches in diameter, secured by
boiler-iron plates three-eighths of an inch thick and 12 inches in
diameter, securely fastened as required in the specifications. There was
a necessary deviation from the plan as to the place the rod nearest the
east side of the building should be placed. Early in the prosecution of
the work a portion of the debris in contact with the eastern wall was
removed. During the night following this a section of the south end of
the east wall fell, carrying with it that portion of the wall between
the south and east rooms to which the plan required said rod to be
attached. In consequence the contractors placed the rod so as to connect
it with the portion of the wall
<span class = "pagenum">342</span>
<a name = "page342"> </a>
still intact. As a brace to the south wall it is placed advantageously.
In excavation, underpinning, and filling in the contractors have
exceeded the limitations prescribed in the contract, and have therefore
performed an amount of work for the remuneration of which there is no
provision. The following table shows the amount of work authorized in
each of the four items with reference to which the contract was drawn
and the amount actually performed by contractors:</div>

<div class = "letter">
From this it will be observed that, taking the rate of compensation
provided for in the contract as a basis, the contractors have performed
work in excess of that authorized to the amount of $638 [$637]. They are
fully advised that there is no provision for the payment of this excess.
The requirements of the contract are, in my opinion, fully met in the
quality of material used and the work performed.</div>

<div class = "letter">
The preservation of the ruin is incomplete. There are six places where
lintels have disappeared and not been replaced and a corresponding
number of cavities that should be filled. Deep seams have been cut in
the walls by the action of the elements, and unless far greater
provision is made for its protection the work already done will be of
small avail.</div>

<div class = "letter">
At many places where the débris came in contact with the wall
disintegration seems to have resulted. At a slight touch it frequently
crumbles. Owing to this fact two sections of the wall fell during the
progress of the work when the debris was removed&mdash;one from the east
wall, described above, and one from the south wall near the west
extremity. These breaches maybe observed as shown in two of the six
accompanying photographs [plates <span class = "smallroman"><a href =
"#plate120">CXX</a>, <a href = "#plate121">CXXI</a></span>]. These
photographs
<span class = "pagenum">343</span>
<a name = "page343"> </a>
were taken ten days before the work was completed. There being no
professional photographer in that vicinity I was compelled to take
advantage of the kind offer of Mr H.&nbsp;H. Burrell, an amateur
photographer, who happened to be there at that time. Thus the views I
secured failed to show all the brickwork done. The coating of mortar was
not applied until after the date on which the views were taken, in
consequence of which the bare bricks are shown in the views.</div>

<div class = "letter">
During the progress of work in removing the debris a number of articles
of interest to the ethnologist were found at various depths and
localities. They have been packed by the contractors and will be sent to
the National Museum.</div>

<div class = "letter">
The floors in the center, north, and east rooms were found to be about 8
feet above the ground surface. The material was similar to that of which
the walls are composed. The west and south rooms appeared to have had
floors at one time on the same level, but the surfaces had
disintegrated, and there was a mass of loose earth, which was removed to
a depth of 6.9 feet below the floors of the other three rooms, where
another floor was found slightly less firm than those.</div>

<div class = "letter">
Reverend Isaac T. Whittemore, who has been designated by the honorable
the Secretary of the Interior as the custodian of the ruin, rendered me
valuable assistance in the performance of my mission. He has manifested
a zealous concern for the preservation of the ruin and has given time
and labor to that end. There is no provision for his just compensation.
I therefore recommend that if any funds be found available after the
payment of the amount due the contractors the same be ordered paid to Mr
Whittemore for his services.</div>

report concerning a recommendation by Reverend Isaac T. Whittemore,
under date of July 25, that

<a name = "page345"> </a>
provision be made for further protecting Casa Grande ruin, near
Florence, Arizona, by the erection of a suitable roof, has been under
consideration.</div>

<div class = "letter">
In many respects Casa Grande ruin is one of the most noteworthy relics
of a prehistoric age and people remaining within the limits of the
United States. It was discovered, already in a ruinous condition, by
Padre Kino in 1694, and since that time it has been a subject of record
by explorers and historians. Thus its history is exceptionally extended
and complete. By reason of its early discovery and its condition when
first seen by white men, it is known that Casa Grande is a strictly
aboriginal structure; and archeologic researches in this country and
Mexico afford grounds for considering it a typical structure for its
times and for the natives of the southwestern region. Many other
structures were mentioned or described by the Spanish explorers, but the
impressions of these explorers were tinctured by previous experience in
an inhospitable region, and their descriptions were tinged by the
romantic ideas of the age; very few of these structures were within the
limits of the United States, and nearly all of these situated in the
neighboring republic of Mexico disappeared long ago; there is hardly a
structure left, except Casa Grande ruin, by which the early accounts of
Spanish explorers in North America can be checked and
interpreted&mdash;none other of its class exists in the United States.
Casa Grande ruin is, therefore, a relic of exceptional importance and of
essentially unique character.</div>

<div class = "letter">
Unfortunately this structure, like others erected by the most advanced
among the native races in the southwest, is of perishable material; it
is built of adobe, or rather of cajon, i.e., of a puddled clay, molded
into walls, dried in the sun. Such walls would stand a short time only
in humid regions; but in the arid region the material is desiccated and
baked under cloudless sky and sun for many months at a time, and becomes
so hard as to resist, fairly, the rare storms of the region. It is by
reason of climatal conditions that cajon and adobe have come into
general use for building in southwestern United States, as in contiguous
parts of Mexico; and it is by reason of the same conditions that a few
of the ancient structures remain, and the best preserved of all is found
in the Gila valley, one of the most desert regions on the western
hemisphere. Yet the best of the cajon structures is perishable; so long
as the roof remains and the summits of the walls are protected,
disintegration proceeds slowly; but when the projecting roof is removed,
the rare but violent storms attack the walls, and they are gradually
channeled and gullied by the storm waters, while the exterior surface
gradually disintegrates and falls away under the alternate wetting and
drying. Even in the most arid regions, the earth-built structures
typical of the southwest are surely, albeit slowly, ravaged and
destroyed.</div>

<div class = "letter">
Several years ago Casa Grande ruin was brought into general notice
throughout the United States in consequence of southwestern
explorations;
<span class = "pagenum">346</span>
<a name = "page346"> </a>
and in 1889, in response to a petition from several illustrious
Americans, the Congress of the United States, at the instance of Senator
Hoar, of Massachusetts, made an appropriation of $2,000 for the purpose
of undertaking the preservation of this ruin. This appropriation was
expended in works urgently required to prevent the falling of the walls
and final destruction of the ruin; they included metal stays for the
walls, with brickwork for the support and protection of the walls at
their bases. Subsequently an area of about 480 acres, including the
ruin, was reserved from settlement by Executive order. A custodian was
also appointed, and, as this office has been informed, has been
continued down to the present. This action on the part of the
legislative and executive branches of the Government can only be
regarded as indicating a desire and continued intention to preserve the
ruin for the benefit of the people of the United States.</div>

<div class = "letter">
The expenditures thus far authorized for the preservation of Casa Grande
ruin have been made in such manner as to meet the most urgent needs
only, and without them the structure would probably have been, before
this time, beyond the reach of preservation. The preservative works were
undertaken as emergency measures, rather than as steps in carrying out a
well-considered plan. From the outset it has been understood by
architects and archeologists and others familiar with the structure that
preservation can be insured only by throwing a roof over the entire ruin
in such manner as to protect the walls from the fierce rainstorms which
occasionally occur in the Gila valley. No lesser work will preserve the
ruin more than a generation or two; and unless this work of roofing is
contemplated and is undertaken within a few years, the emergency work
will be of little avail and the money expended therein will be lost.
Accordingly, assuming a desire and continued intention on the part of
the Government to preserve this noteworthy relic, no hesitation is felt
in recommending that a suitable roof be placed over Casa Grande ruin, at
such time as may be expedient; and, in view of the rapidity with which
destruction is now in progress, there is no hesitation in saying that
the work should be undertaken at the earliest practicable date.</div>

<div class = "letter">
It should be added that neither the Director nor any of the
collaborators in the Bureau of American Ethnology have visited Casa
Grande ruin for some three years, and accordingly that there are no data
in this office to indicate whether there is especially urgent necessity
for undertaking preservative work at this time; but much confidence is
placed in the judgment of the custodian, Reverend Isaac T. Whittemore,
who is known to several collaborators in the Bureau.</div>

<div class = "letter">
The subject of the preservation of Casa Grande, in many respects the
most noteworthy ruin in the United States, is deemed important; and if
the Secretary of the Interior desires more specific information
concerning the present condition of the ruin, as a basis for further
action or judgment, it will be a pleasure to have an officer of this
Bureau
<span class = "pagenum">347</span>

<span class = "smallcaps">Dear Sir</span>: I am in receipt of your
letter of the 28th ultimo submitting a report upon the recommendation
made by the Reverend Isaac T. Whittemore, custodian, that provision be
made for further protection of the Casa Grande ruin near Florence,
Arizona, by the erection of a suitable roof.</div>

<div class = "letter">
In response thereto I have to state that more specific information
concerning the present condition of the ruin and the probable cost of
providing proper protection for it is desirable in the preparation of an
estimate to be submitted to Congress with a view of securing
appropriation for the work. To this end the Department gladly avails
itself of your offer to send an officer of your Bureau, at its expense,
to make a special examination and report on the ruin during the autumn
of this year.</div>

<i>Washington, November 15, 1895.</i></div>

<div class = "letter">
<span class = "smallcaps">Sir</span>: Pursuant to a proposal made in
connection with a report from this office relating to the ruins known as
Casa Grande, near Florence, Arizona, under date of August 28, 1895, and
to the acceptance of this proposal in a communication from the
Department of the Interior under date of September 12, 1895, Mr W&nbsp;J
McGee, ethnologist in charge of the Bureau of American Ethnology, has
within a few days made an examination of Casa Grande ruin with the view
of determining the need for further protection of the ruin by a roof or
otherwise.</div>

<div class = "letter">
There are in this office two series of photographs representing the
ruin. The first series was taken in 1892 before the protective works
authorized by the Congress were commenced; the second series represents
the work in progress. In the recent examination the present condition of
the ruin was carefully compared with the condition represented in the
photographs.</div>

<div class = "letter">
On comparing the profiles of the walls, it was found that in many cases
the irregular upper surfaces retain the exact configuration of 1892,
even to the slightest knobs and rain-formed crevices; the correspondence
being so close as to show that the injury and loss by weathering during
the interim has been imperceptible. In some other cases, notably along
the southern and eastern walls, the profiles are more extensively
modified; some of the points and knobs shown in the photographs are
gone, some of the old crevices are widened and deepened, and some new
crevices appear; and in some parts it can be seen that walls are lowered
several inches. On the whole the modification of the profiles of the
walls is limited, yet such as to indicate that destruction is proceeding
at a not inconsiderable rate.</div>

<div class = "letter">
On comparing the scars and crevices on the sides of the walls, it was
found that, while many remain essentially unchanged, most are enlarged
and deepened. This is particularly noteworthy on the eastern and
southern walls, which are most beaten by wind-driven rains, and which
are also most modified in profile. It would appear that destruction is
proceeding more rapidly along the sides of the walls than along the
crests.</div>

<div class = "letter">
On examining the walls with respect to apparent solidity and stability,
it was found that nearly all are in fair or good condition. The only
portion that would seem in special danger is the central section of the
southern exterior wall. This section seems insecure, and might at any
time be overthrown by a heavy wind following a rain storm. This section
was not, unfortunately, braced or tied to the stronger interior wall
when the protective works were carried out in 1892.</div>

<div class = "letter">
<span class = "pagenum">349</span>
<a name = "page349"> </a>
On examining the structure to ascertain the effect of the protective
works of 1892 in staying the destructive processes, particularly the
undermining of the walls by spattering rain and drifting sand, it was
found that in most cases the results have been excellent. On the inner
side of the middle section of the southern exterior wall sapping is in
progress at the ground level, and also along the rows of joist openings
for the first and second stories, and in a few other places the
protection seems inadequate; but in general the anticipations of the
projectors of the protective works seem to have been realized.</div>

<div class = "letter">
The most serious of the destructive processes was sapping, and this
process has been nearly checked by the protective works. The second was
the desurfacing and subsequent eating away of the walls by beating rains
and frost, and this is still in progress at a moderate rate. The least
serious process was the wearing away of the crests of the walls by rain
and winds, and this is still going on at a perceptible rate. It is
impossible to determine, and difficult even to approximate, the rate of
destruction quantitatively, especially so since it goes on cumulatively,
with constantly increasing rapidity, as the cemented surfaces are
destroyed and the crevices widen and deepen; but judging from the
history of the ruin, and from the rate of destruction indicated by
comparing the photographs of 1892 with the present aspect, it would seem
safe to conclude that, if protected completely from vandalism, the ruin
will be comparatively little injured during the next five years, and
will stand perhaps half a century, without further protective works,
before moldering into dust.</div>

<div class = "letter">
In view of the slow yet ever increasing rate of destruction of the ruin,
and of its great interest as a tangible record of the prehistoric
inhabitants of this country, no hesitation is felt in recommending that
the structure be further protected, and practically perpetuated, by a
suitable roof, so designed as to shield the walls from rain and sun and
at the same time permit an unobstructed view of the ruin from any
direction.</div>

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
